# library
Library project from The Odin Project built using JS, CSS and HTML.

## Functionality
* New book button lets the user add a book title, author and number of pages.
* The book is turned into a object using a object constructor and then stored in an array. 
* The object is then displayed on the page as a card.
* Delete button removes card and corresponding object in array using the data attribute.

## Thoughts
* I learned how to get data forms and use in JS.
* First time using object constructors in a project, understand how useful they are.
